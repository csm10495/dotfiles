# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. 

To auto-install (THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING ONES!)

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csm10495/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash

# restart your bash or source the various dotfiles
(like: source ~/.bashrc)
```

To update (THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY CHANGES YOU'VE MADE). Call this in bash:

``
_update_dotfiles
``
